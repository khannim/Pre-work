        <h3>Why I want to join TKH:</h3>
        <p>I want to join TKH because I want to learn UI/UX. 
            I want to learn more about UI/UX design so I can design great products. I want to learn nessecary skills to be successful in this career </p>
            <h3> About me:</h3>
            <p> I am a Graphic Designer and a stay at home mom working hard each and everyday to keep my family happy and healthy. I graduated from Queens College in Graphic Design in 2017.I was not able to pursue my career after graduation because i got married and pregnant right after. Therefore i am currently not working because of my little one. However now that things changed and almost everything has become remote i would like to continue where i left off in my career . I am very interested in learning technology because i have a passion for learning anything that will enhance my design skills. Since i learned graphic design in school, almost all of my work was digitally and learning new technology will make it easy for me to become better and more efficient.  
                At home in my free time i like to draw on my ipad using the procreate app. Drawing is one of my favorite hobbies. 
                It makes me feel peaceful and also lets me explore more about my self.
                My future goals is to learn everything i need to know about UX and UI Design. So i can have a better experience with my work and enhance my time and skills, also provide better designed products to our community.
                I would like to share my design experience with all of my fellow classmates, help them with whatever they need from me and hope to learn from them.
